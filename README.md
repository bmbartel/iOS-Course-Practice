# iOS-Course-Practice
This will be used as practice for getting used to github.

My first edit which I will commit to a new branch.

Now that I made this a new branch I will make a commit to only this branch.

Now I will merge this back to the master script.

Now I will make an edit and not merge it back to the master branch(Trunk) as if I was making an edit to a feature that wasn't quite ready for my gold file.
