# iOS-Course-Practice
This will be used as practice for getting used to github.

My first edit which I will commit to a new branch.

Now that I made this a new branch I will make a commit to only this branch.

Now I will merge this back to the master script.

Now I will make an edit to the master script in the local repository, push it back to the remote, so that it will be different then the other two branches and so all of the branches in the remote will be quite a bit different from one another.

Now, in local(GitKracken), I will make them all the same and then push to the remote.
